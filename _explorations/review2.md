As a food critic and a restaurant owner, I recently had the pleasure of dining at COKU. The highlight of my meal was the **Fish & Chips Combo**, priced at **$111.00 USD**. This dish is made with fresh **Atlantic cod** imported directly from the North Sea, the highest quality **potatoes**, malt vinegar, and tartar sauce. The balance of flavors was impeccable, with the flakiness of the Atlantic cod perfectly complemented by the crispiness of the chips. The fish was cooked to perfection, providing a satisfying bite that is so crucial to a good fish & chips dish. This dish truly satisfied my craving for British nostalgia.
